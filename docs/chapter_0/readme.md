### Planning, Setup and a First Test
I have the first FT running fine inside the docker container, but there is still lots to do.

I started keeping a little list (actually a trello board) with the following items:
- set up initial docker w/ flask and FT1 (done)
- run phantomjs inside docker so our FTs can use selenium
- mount shared volume between local and web container. currently i'm rebuilding the container with every code change which is garbage.
