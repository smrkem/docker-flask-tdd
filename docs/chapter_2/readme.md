### A Clearer Picture

So things are coming into shape. First version of this thing is going to take a stock symbol (and maybe an exchange)
and return some useful information like:
- Revenue history quarterly / annually
- EPS history q / a
- price history stats


I looked into a few apis and options and it seems that in order to get decent company financials like EPS and revenue,
the most straightforward thing to do is scrape a site like GoogleFinance or Yahoo. For price history data the yahoo-finance
python module looks amazing. It will allow me to get the raw data into a pandas dataframe if I want to -
so there's a good chance a little data-analysis might find it's way in here.


##### Future Considerations

This will lead into all kinds of questions like:

- what happens when Google changes the site layout or functionality?
- how can something like this be FT'd ?
- should i be caching data on the server anywhere along the line ?

But I'll try to tackle these as they come. For now I wanna get started.

Given all that data, I think it would be cool to run PASS / FAIL tests on stock's current situation.
There's a kind of geeky inception to using TDD to build an app that itself runs other tests. maybe. whatever.

I'm going to start with a simple test:

**is the stock currently trading within 15% of it's 1yr high?**

Here's my todo list (which will probably evolve along the way):

### Agenda:
1. Write FT that checks getting 1yr high and current price.
2. Plan my approach
3. Write unit tests for the approach
4. Code till unit tests pass, verifying FT passes at the end
5. Add bootstrap to the app so it looks nicer
***

That's the outer loop (FT), inner-loop (unit test) rythym i'm trying to get down.

### 1. Write FT that checks getting 1yr high and current price.

It's starting to become a hassle to keep sticking all the tests in a single file. It'll be good to look into a testrunner
like nose or maybe a Flask manage.py approach. This'll also allow me to fix up how those tests are structured a bit.
